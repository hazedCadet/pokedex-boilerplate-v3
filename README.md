**[Pokedex](https://github.com/hazedCadet/pokedex-boilerplate-v3)** is a fullstack pokedex that allows trainers to catch rename and release pokemon.

## Key Features

* Catch Pokemon
* Rename Pokemon
* Release Pokemon

## How To Use
- Load Pokedex in broswer

- Add pokemon info to pokedex
  
- View pokedex entry on pokemon

- Release pokemon

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL - PostgreSQL is used for persistent data storage. Pokemon are tied to trainers through the database tables.
- React - React is used to present the website.
- Express - Express is used to direct traffic and API calls.

As we learned React it was hard to incorporate all the elements. It was tricky to compartmentalize all the HTML segments to mesh together.
Database was also tricky as in this case many pokemon could be repeated as they are not unique. This could not be replicated in the database.
Given more time I think the pokdedex could be greatly improved.
